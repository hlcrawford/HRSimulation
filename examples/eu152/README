Several gamma-ray calibration sources are implemented in UCGretina
which can be accessed with the 

    /Experiment/RunSource

and 

    /Experiment/Source/Set

commands. The macro file eu152_gammas.mac illustrates this
approach. These simulations are based on intensities adopted by the
IAEA for standard calibration sources and should be used for
efficiency calibrations.

In addition, realistic gamma-ray cascades from stationary sources can
be simulated using the 

    /BeamOut/Source

and

    /BeamOut/LevelSchemeFile

commands. The macro files sm152.mac and gd152.mac and the level scheme
files sm152.lvl and gd152.lvl illustrate this approach. The level
scheme files are based on ENSDF adopted beta- and gamma-decay
branching ratios. The experimental uncertainties in the branching
ratios combine to yield gamma-ray intensities that do not match the
IAEA values. The resulting spectra should not be used for efficiency 
calibrations.

o Run the simulations

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulations of the 152Eu source described in
    eu152_gammas.mac, sm152.mac, and gd152.mac. The Makefile automates
    the following steps:

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to eu152_gammas.dat, sm152.dat, and
    gd152.dat. (The names of the output files are specified in the
    .mac files.)

  - SimCalculate is used to load the mode 2 data in the .dat files into 
    calibrated trees in eu152_gammas_sim.root, sm152_sim.root, and
    gd152_sim.root.

  - Sim_histos is used to sort the calibrated trees into histograms
    written to eu152_gammas_sim_histos.root and
    eu152_sim_histos.root. The trees in sm152_sim.root and
    gd152_sim.root are sorted into a single set of spectra in
    eu152_sim_histos.root.

o Fit a measured spectrum

  - The root files ./data/run022_cal_histos.root and 
    ./data/run007_cal_histos.root are measured 152Eu and room
    background spectra measured with the standard NSCL configuration
    of Gretina in September 2012.

  - The root script eu152Fit.C fits the measured spectrum with a
    linear combination of the room background and simulated
    spectra. (The background scaling is set with a fit above 1540
    keV.)

      $ root
      $ .L eu152Fit.C
      $ fitSpectrum()

    The simulated spectrum is the response to 1E6 gamma rays, and fit
    parameter 1 is the scaling factor. The measured spectrum
    corresponds to 

      Run020: free running, 595.6 live seconds, 9/17/2012
      Source activity:
      (313100(4400) Bq on 5/1/1978)*(0.5)^(34.3819 years/13.537 years) 
                        = 53841(754) Bq

        (53841(750) Bq)*(595.6 seconds)*(1.537 gamma rays/decay) 
                        =  4.93(7)E7 gamma rays emitted

    so the scaling factor (parameter p1 in the fit results below)
    should be 49.3(7).

  - The fixed parameters p2 and p3 are threshold parameters. Freeing
    these finds the best-fit threshold parameters for the entire
    array. However, it is preferable to determine threshold parameters
    crystal-by-crystal and fold in simulated crystal thresholds at the 
    SimCalculate stage as is done here (thresholds in run020_run007.thresh).

    (This only affects lab-frame energies below about 200 keV --- not
    always worth pursuing.)
