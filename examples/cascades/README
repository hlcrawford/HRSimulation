parallel.mac: a level scheme with two parallel cascades
superDef.mac: single 10-step cascade

In parallel.mac and superDef.mac, the initial excitation energy of the
reaction product is specified as usual. For example in parallel.mac:

/BeamOut/ProjectileExcitation 2000. keV

but an additional command sets the name of a level scheme file:

/BeamOut/LevelSchemeFile parallel.lvl

This file specifies the decay properties of excited states of the
reaction product.

The level scheme file describes the portion of the level scheme
populated by de-excitation of the initial state, including the initial
state. (The initial state must be at the energy specified by the
/BeamOut/ProjectileExcitation command.) The format of the level scheme
file:

<Level energy [keV]>  <Number of gamma-decay Branches>  <Lifetime [ps]>
<BR 1>   <Final-state energy [keV]>  <A0>  <A2>  <A4>
<BR 2>   <Final-state energy [keV]>  <A0>  <A2>  <A4>
...
<Level energy [keV]>  <Number of gamma-decay Branches>  <Lifetime [ps]>
<BR 1>   <Final-state energy [keV]>  <A0>  <A2>  <A4>
<BR 2>   <Final-state energy [keV]>  <A0>  <A2>  <A4>
...

where <BR N> are branching rations, <A0>, <A2>, <A4> are gamma-ray
angular distribution coefficients.

For example, the first three lines in parallel.lvl describe an
excited state at 2000 keV which decays with zero lifetime either to a
state at 1500 keV with BR 0.25 or to a state at 1200 keV with BR 0.75.

In this example, we populate an initial state at 2000 keV. The file
levelScheme.dat describes a level scheme giving two possible cascades: 

2000 -> 1500 -> 1200 -> 0    and    2000->1200->0

The resulting spectrum will show gamma rays at 300, 500, 800, and 1200 keV.
