This example illustrates the use of the /BeamOut/Source command with
the /BeamOut/LevelSchemeFile command to simulate a stationary
166Ho source. Gamma cascades are simulated, so this approach produces events
with realistic multiplicity for gamma-gamma conicidence gating.

The level scheme of the 166Er decay product is specified in the level
scheme file er166.lvl.  The relative populations of the levels and the
gamma branching ratios are taken from ENSDF.

================================================================================

o In this directory, type

    $ make

  to run the simulation of the 166Ho source measurement described in
  ho166.mac. The Makefile automates the following steps:

o UCGretina writes mode 2 data to ho166.dat. (The name of the output
  file is specified in ho166.mac.)

o SimCalculate is used to load the mode 2 data in ho166.dat into a
  calibrated tree in ho166_sim.root

o Sim_histos is used to sort the calibrated tree into histograms
  written to ho166_sim_histos.root
