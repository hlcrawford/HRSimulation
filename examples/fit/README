  The gamma-ray scaling factors are parameters p5-p8. Multiply the
  scaling factor by the number of events simulated (1E6 here) to
  get the number of gamma rays emitted in the experiment to produce
  measured spectrum.

  Conveniently, the exact scaling factors for the peaks are known,
  because this is simulated data. They are 

    p5 = 0.001
    p6 = 0.002
    p7 = 0.005
    p8 = 0.01

================================================================================
To set up your own fit ...

- Make a copy of the fit example subdirectory.

  $ cp -r fit <destination path>

- Make a new set of .mac files for the beam, target, and gamma rays
  you want to simulate.

- Modify the list of targets at the top of the Makefile.

- Use ./change_geometry.sh to point to the geometry files for your
  GRETINA configuration 

- Modify the settings file for SimCalculate (example.set here) to specify your
  configuration of Gretina, analysis beta, resolution parameter file,
  and threshold parameter file

- Analyze the (simulated) reaction products to determine the
  analysis beta and the average post-target kinetic energy of your
  reaction products:

  To determine the value of beta giving the best Doppler
  reconstruction, modify example_ions.mac to describe your beam,
  reaction product, and target.

  The ideal beta value to use in Doppler reconstruction of
  gamma-ray spectra is the average beta of the reaction products
  at the times they emitted gamma rays. This depends on the target
  material and thickness and on the lifetime of the excited state
  in question, so it is important that these parameters match
  those you use in your gamma-ray simulation.

  Run the simulation:

  $ UCGretina example_ions.mac > example_ions.log

  We don't have a way to measure source velocities directly in an
  experiment, but the simulation can tell us what they are.

  $ root

  root [0] .L ions.C 
  root [1] makeTree("example_ions.log")

  Double click on ion.betar in the tree browser to get the
  distribution of source betas. The mean value in the statistics box
  is the optimal analysis beta. (For this example, 100 MeV/u 44S in a
  376 mg/cm^2 9Be target and a state with 0 lifetime: 0.4168)

  Also double click on ion.KE to find the average kinetic energy of
  the reaction products after leaving the target. This is the kinetic 
  energy you should specify with the /Mode2/S800KE command in your
  macro files for calculating simulated DTA values.

- Run the simulations:

  $ make

- Modify Fit.C: 

  * Modify the function fitf() so that it adds in the correct 
    number of simulated gamma rays

  * Modify the file names (the measured spectrum and the
    simulations) in the function fitSpectrum(). Note that the
    simulation file names do not include extensions. This is
    intentional, and important.
