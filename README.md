# UCGretina v3.3 #

## Compile and install ##

Install version 4.9.6.p03 of the Geant4 libraries from
http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/download.shtml. You will need
the data files for low energy electromagnetic processes. 

_Important note: UCGretina is not yet compatible with the latest
version (4.10.x) of the Geant4 libraries._

Simulating the LBL scanning table requires the external
[CADMesh](https://github.com/christopherpoole/cadmesh) package. Paths
to the CADMesh `include` and `lib` directories must be set in the
GNUMakefile.

Set up your environment (consider adding this to your `.bashrc`):

    $ source <G4INSTALL>/share/Geant4-9.6.3/geant4make/geant4make.sh

Compile:

    $ make

To use the LBL scanning table:

    $ make SCANNING=1

(produces the binary UCGretina_Scan)

To use the liquid hydrogen target:

    $ make LHTARGET=1

(produces the binary UCGretina_LH)

Executables are automatically installed in

    $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM

(which is added to your path when you source `geant4make.sh`)

## Examples ##

Several examples are in the examples subdirectory, including
illustrations of fitting simulations to measured source and in-beam
spectra. In the examples, the GrROOT package is used for sorting the
mode 2 output from UCGretina.

> kinematics draw from this scattering-angle distribution. This is
> the alternative to providing a lab-frame scattering-angle distribution 
> with the `/BeamOut/XsectFile` command.

    /BeamOut/ThetaMin <double> <unit>

    /BeamOut/ThetaMax <double> <unit>

> Limits of the scattering angle distribution used in the 2-body
> reaction kinematics. If a scattering-angle distribution is supplied

    /BeamOut/seta0 <double> 

    /BeamOut/seta2 <double> 

    /BeamOut/seta4 <double>

>       ...

> where <BR N> are branching ratios, <A0>, <A2>, <A4> are gamma-ray
> angular distribution coefficients. The <Relative direct population>
> parameters determine how often the level is populated directly by

> NOTE: This command supersedes values set with the
> `/BeamOut/ProjectileExcitation`, `/BeamOut/TargetExcitation`,
> `/BeamOut/seta0`, `/BeamOut/seta2`, `/BeamOut/seta4`, and `/BeamOut/tau`
> commands described above.

> described under **Source Simulations** below, in which gamma-rays are 
> emitted as primary particles._

_The geometries specified in `./GretinaGeometry/Scan0`, 
`./GretinaGeometry/Scan1`, `./GretinaGeometry/Scan2`, and 
`./GretinaGeometry/Scan3` orient the GRETINA module such that the 
corresponding crystal is centered on the slits._

### Liquid Hydrogen Target ###

(UCGretina_LH only)

Optional commands for setting LH target parameters (must precede

> The "empty" type is the cell body with no window frames. (To

> the LH-target beam pipe without the target assembly.

    /Target/Bulge <double> <unit>

Mandatory command for building the LH target (UCGretina_LH):

    /Target/Construct

## Output ##

Output can be written in ASCII and/or "Mode 2" binary format. Raw
tracking information can also be written to standard output.

### ASCII Output ###

The optional command

    /Output/Filename <filename>

activates ASCII output.

If energy was deposited in GRETINA in the event, S800 data and
decomposed gamma-ray information are written: 

    S   <ATA>   <BTA>   <DTA>   <YTA>   <Event #>
    D   <# of decomposed gamma events>   <Event #>
    C   <Crystal ID>   <# of interaction points>
        <Segment ID>   <Energy>   <X>   <Y>   <Z>
        <Segment ID>   <Energy>   <X>   <Y>   <Z>
    C   <Crystal ID>   <# of interaction points>
        <Segment ID>   <Energy>   <X>   <Y>   <Z>
        <Segment ID>   <Energy>   <X>   <Y>   <Z>
    ...

The energy, emission position, emission direction, and the velocity of
the projectile are written for each gamma ray emitted in every event:

    E   <# of emitted gamma rays>    <Full Energy>     <Event #>
        <Energy>   <X>   <Y>   <Z>   <theta>   <phi>   <beta>
        <Energy>   <X>   <Y>   <Z>   <theta>   <phi>   <beta>
        ...

`<Full Energy> = 1` if a single gamma ray is emitted and its
full energy is deposited in a single crystal. `<Full Energy> = 0` if a
single gamma ray is emitted and only part of its energy is deposited
in any one crystal. `<Full Energy> = -1` otherwise.

The optional command

    /Output/DetectorsOnly

writes detected gamma-ray information only. Simulated S800 and emitted
gamma-ray information is suppressed.

### Mode 2 Output ###

Mode 2 output from in-beam simulations contains S800 tracking events
(GEB type 9), decomposed gamma-ray events (GEB type 1), and emitted
gamma-ray (GEB type 11). (Source simulations do not produce S800
tracking events.) S800 tracking events are only written for events in
which gamma rays are detected. Emitted gamma-ray events are written
for every event. They include the energies, emission positions, and
emission directions of all gamma rays emitted in an event.

Energies are expressed in keV, and positions are expressed in mm.

### Commands related to mode 2 output ###

    /Mode2/Filename <filename>

> This optional command activates Mode 2 output.

    /Mode2/crmatFile <filename>

> The file `crmat.LINUX` is provided. It specifies the rotation
> matrices and translation vectors from each crystal frame into the
> world coordinate system. UCGretina inverts this transformation to
> produce data in the crystal frames, as expected in Mode 2 data.

    /Mode2/crystalXforms

> Internal transformations from the world frame to the crystal 
> frames are used. This is an alternative to specifying a crmat
> file. There are small deviations in crystal placement from the
> design positions. Therefore, using the standard crmat file
> introduces offsets in the crystal-frame hit patterns. Using the
> internal transormations does not.

    /Mode2/GretinaCoords

> When this command is present, the world coordinates are rotated Pi/2
> about z to match the standard GRETINA coordinate system (x = down, z
> = beam). This is the coordinate system expected in Mode 2 data. This
> only affects the decomposed gamma-ray events. 

> Interaction points are expressed in the Geant4 coordinate system 
> (y = up, z = beam) by default. 

    /Mode2/PackingRes <float> <unit>

> The PackingRes parameter determines the closest spacing of
> gamma-ray interaction points within each segment that GRETINA can
> resolve. Simulated interaction points are consolidated
> accordingly. Specify a zero position resolution to turn off
> consolidation.

    /Mode2/S800KE <float> <unit>

> Specifies the kinetic energy of the reaction product centered in the
> acceptance of the S800. This is needed for calculating DTA
> (dT/T) values of the S800 tracking events in the Mode2 output. 

    /Mode2/Print

> This command triggers printing of information on Mode 2 data to
> stdout. 

### Raw Tracking Information ###

    /GammaPrint/Track_Set

> Print gamma-ray tracking information to standard output.

    /IonPrint/Track_Set

> Print ion tracking information to standard output.

## Visualization ##

Run the macro file `vis/vis.mac` an interactive session:

    $ UCGretina

    Idle> /control/execute vis/vis.mac
    Idle> exit

This generates a VRML 2 file named `g4_XX.wrl` which can be viewed
with a VRML viewer (like mayavi2). Macro files are included for
visualizing GRETA, the LBL scanning table, and the liquid-hydrogen
target setups. These scripts must be run in a directory with soft
links (aclust, euler, aslice, asolid, awalls) to the appropriate
GRETINA geometry files. 

The macro file `./vis/trajectories.mac` illustrates how to add particle
trajectories to visulatizations.

Within mayavi2, the python scripts `./vis/mlab.animate.py` and
`./vis/mlab.movie.py` can be run (File -> Run Python Script). The
former animates the scene, and the latter saves the animation frames
as a series of .png files which can be stitched together into an
animated png or gif.
